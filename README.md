###Basic Dice Game
This game is a basic learning of function and operators of javascript.
In this game , I used some images of dice at different outcomes.
There are four different dices on the webpage that comes with different outcomes on refreshing the page along with the result on the number of dices and that shows the winner of the games.
This is one player game.
###
Javascript is mostly used in form of basic selector , operators , mathematical function floor() , etc;
Css is used in the form of creating display of dices clearely in a row and some designing to the title of the game.

I learnt it from The Web Development course of @Angela Yu .
